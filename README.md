# FinalProject

## Remaining problems :

#### - On the RecyclerView :

Maybe this error comes from the VideoListActivity, in the method onResponse, I tried to fill the VideoEntries list of VideoEntry,
with the items I get from the request.

  - All the items have the same name.
  - Need to use Picasso to display thumbnail from his url.
 
 
#### - On the YoutubeStandAlonePlayer :

  - There is a network error, I can't display the video.
